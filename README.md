# coffee-maker
This coffee maker tells a user what the menu is, and then asks them to place an order and insert their coins.
The code then checks to see if the machine has enough ingredients and if the user has enough money.
If both conditions are met, it will make and output the user's drink.
Finally, it asks if the user would like to order something else. And if so, it takes them back to the ordering phase.
This will continue as long as there are enough ingredients, and the user can afford it.
